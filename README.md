# Managing-Software-Complexity---The-Cynefin-Framework

**The Cynefin Framework** was developed by **IBM researchers**, including **Dave Snowden**, to help people identify and understand complex systems and determine the appropriate approach to decision making and problem solving in this context. It is based on the premise that complex systems have 5 domains of complexity: _**simple, complicated, complex, chaotic and disordered.**_

**In The Clear (Simple) Domain:** the relationships and communications between the elements within the system are clear and the elements are well defined. This makes it easier to predict the consequences of our actions and we can use our expert knowledge to make decisions.

**In The Complicated Domain:** the relationships and communications between the elements within the system are more complex. However, the actions to be taken are still predictable. In this area, we can use our analytical and expert competences to make decisions. However, the specific contexts of the situation must also be taken into account.

**In The Complex Domain:** The relationships between the elements within the system are not fully known and communication is at an incomprehensible level. It is also difficult to predict the consequences of actions. In this situation, we need to be more exploratory in decision-making and we need to be prepared to learn from our experiences and adapt.

**In The Chaotic Domain:** The relationships between the elements within the system are unpredictable and it is very difficult to know what the consequences of our actions will be. At this stage, it is necessary to act urgently and decisively to stabilise the situation. We must also not make decisions without all the information we want to have.

**In The Disorder Domain:** The state of the system is no longer clear or known to which other areas it belongs. Before we can make effective decisions, we need to provide order and clarity in the state of the system.
